# :feet: ABOUT
DOGWATCH is a single page application where a user is able to checkin into local dog parks in their area. It gives users the ability to view how many dogs are at their dog parks, so their dogs don’t have to play by themselves.
You can view the deployed application below
https://dog-watch.herokuapp.com/

# :question:HOW TO USE
The user is able to view how many dogs are located are specific dog parks listed on the main page. If the user wants to checkin, they will need to create an account or log in. Once doing so, they are able to check in and see who is checked in at certain parks (this is classed as a newsfeed and will be added as an additional feature)

- JavaScript
- Html
- Css
- Dom manipulation
- SQL
- Node.Js
- Express

# :pencil2: THE PLANNING
The idea behind this project was by using QR code’s at local dog parks to checkin. This way people can see who is at their local dog parks for their dogs to play with, mostly because when you go to a dog park and you are alone, it can be a bit lonely for your dog. We started off planning who our target market was and by creating user stories show in the diagram here.

We then used Figma to create a simple black and white line diagrams of how we wanted the application to look. We thought starting off as a mobile application first was best as this app was mostly only mobile based. We then moved onto a colour wireframe so we could see how the application would look as a final result. This also helped us find out what features we needed.

We used Trello to split up what we need to do a what parts need to be done first. We had three phases in Trello, this is shown below.

# :bulb: FEATURES TO BE ADDED IN
- With additional time, we would like to include a newsfeed for the user to view where it shows which dogs are at specific parks, for example, if Rachel’s dog Henry is afraid of dogs with high energy they can see if any dogs at their park is checked with with high energy. This can be showed in the below image.
- The Forgotten Password Link - this will give users the ability to change their password with entering their email, name, and other security questions.
- The app is starting out with one local area with additional parks to be added in the next phase
